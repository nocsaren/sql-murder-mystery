## Introduction

I came across an intriguing game called [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) online. While playing, I wanted to verify if my solution for a particular step—where I assumed the last house had the highest number—was correct. However, I found that the site's walkthrough wasn't comprehensive. As a result, I decided to create this detailed walkthrough. Here, I explain the queries, clues, and solutions for each step to identify both the murderer and the villain.

## Pursue the Murderer


You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018, and that it took place in SQL City.

This introduction gives us some clues:

-	Murder  
-	On Jan.15, 2018  
-	SQL City  

It is also given that the database is organized in the following schema:

![](./img/schema.png)

### Crime Scene Report

We'll see the report using this query:  
```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report  
  WHERE city = "SQL City"
    AND date = 20180115 
    AND type = "murder"
```


| date    | type  | description | city |
|:-------:|:-----:|:------------|:----:|
| 20180115| murder| Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".| SQL City|


From this query, we gather three clues:

- There are **two witnesses**.  
- One witness lives in the **last house on Northwestern Dr.**  
- The other witness is **named Annabel** and lives somewhere on **Franklin Ave.**  


We will query the persons table to identify the witnesses by address_street_name, id, and name. We will also query the max(address_number) on "Northwestern Dr", assuming the last house will have the largest address number.  


### Find Witnesses
```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT id, name, address_street_name, max(address_number) FROM person
  WHERE address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr" 
    OR (address_street_name = "Franklin Ave" AND name LIKE "%Annabel%")
  GROUP BY address_street_name

```


| id  | ssn     | name         |address_street_name | max(address_number)|
|:---:|:-------:|:------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
|16371|318771143|Annabel Miller|Franklin Ave        |103                 |
|14887|111564949|Morty Schapiro|Northwestern Dr     |4919                |

### Read Interview Transcripts
We can use the IDs of the witnesses to reach their interview transcripts:


```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT * FROM interview
  WHERE person_id = 16371 OR person_id = 14887
```


| person_id | transcript|
|:---------:|:----------|
| 14887     | I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".|
|16371 | I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.|


We get numerous clues from these interviews:

-	The killer had a **Get Fit Now Gym** bag.  
-	The killer's **membership number starts with "48Z"**.  
-	The killer is a **gold member** of Get Fit Now Gym.   
-	The killer rode a car with a plate including **"H42W"**.  
-	The killer was in the gym on **January 9th**.  

### Check the Gym
We can now query get_fit_now_check_in table with these clues to identify the suspect using get_fit_now_check_in and get_fit_now_member tables.

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT membership_id, name, check_in_date, membership_status FROM get_fit_now_check_in
  JOIN get_fit_now_member ON get_fit_now_member.id = get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id
  WHERE check_in_date = 20180109 AND membership_id LIKE "48Z%"
```

We hit two suspects with that query:



| membership_id | name        | check_in_date | membership_status|
|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| 48Z7A         |Joe Germuska |20180109       |gold              |
| 48Z55         |Jeremy Bowers|20180109       |gold              |

### Run the Plate
We can try running the plate among Get Fit Now members.

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT person.name FROM person
  JOIN drivers_license ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
  JOIN get_fit_now_member ON person.id = get_fit_now_member.person_id
  WHERE plate_number LIKE "%H42W%"
```

We now know the murderer:


**Jeremy Bowers**

Let's verify if we are right:

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');        
  SELECT value FROM solution
```


> Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.

## Pursue the Real Villain
### Interview the Murderer
Oh... It seems Jeremy Bowers was only a pawn in this crime, there was a real villain behind this scheme. We will interview the murderer first:

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT * FROM interview
  WHERE person_id = 67318

```


| person_id| transcript|
|:--------:|:----------|
| 67318    | I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017. |

### Identify the Villain
The desperate murderer gave us many clues about the villain:

- She is a **woman**.
- She has **a lot of money**.
- She is around **65'' - 67'' in height**.
- She has **red hair**.
- She drives a **Tesla Model S**.
- She attended **SQL Symphony Concert** **three times in December 2017**.


We can use all these clues to construct a query and find our villain:

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
SELECT name FROM drivers_license
  JOIN person ON drivers_license.id = person.license_id
  JOIN income ON income.ssn = person.ssn
  JOIN facebook_event_checkin ON facebook_event_checkin.person_id = person.id
  WHERE drivers_license.gender = "female" 
      AND drivers_license.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67 
      AND drivers_license.hair_color = "red" 
    	AND drivers_license.car_make = "Tesla" 
    	AND facebook_event_checkin.event_name LIKE "%Symphony%"
      AND facebook_event_checkin.date LIKE "201712%" 
	  GROUP BY person_id
    HAVING count(facebook_event_checkin.date) = 3
```

And this query returns us the name:

**Miranda Priestly**

Again, let us check our answer:
```{sql, eval = FALSE}
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
  SELECT value FROM solution;
```

> Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the champagne!

## Conclusion

This concludes the walkthrough. I hope you enjoyed following it and that it helped you progress in the game.
